// Number Type -

let num: number = 100;

// Assigning any kind of number is possible -
num = 28.7;

num = Infinity * 0.1;

num = parseInt("12"); // parsing the string to number and storing it in "num" variable

// num = "123"; // but we cannot directly assign a string number as auto type cast will happen in runtime and ts will throw error before that in the development phase as it is now allowed
